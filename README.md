Theme Automator
=======================

Sets a different color scheme for every file type in [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2).

This plug-in is **NOT** yet tested on Sublime Text 3, maybe it could work.

It adds a context menu named ThemeAutomator:

###Changes in 1.0.2
Added property `automate_selection` in User settings `ThemeAutomator.sublime-settings` to apply themes automatically without using the context menu.


###Changes in 1.0.1
Added Package Setting preferences menu in `Preferences > Package Settings > ThemeAutomator`
